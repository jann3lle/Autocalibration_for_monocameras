# Autocalibration_for_monocameras
The purpose of this project is to automate the calibration of mono-cameras across 10 different zoom levels for use in laparoscopic liver surgery. 

Liver cancer remains a major global health issue, ranking as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and sixth among women, the need for more effective treatment options is especially prominent. Surgical removal, often via Open surgery or Minimally invasive laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery, is the primary intervention. While laparoscopic surgery offers significant benefits, such as reduced patient trauma and faster recovery, its adoption remains limited due to challenges such as its restricted field of view and maneuverability, increasing technical demands for surgeons. Image guidance systems have been developed to support these procedures by offering enhanced 3D visualization of critical structures during surgery. However, existing systems face challenges including non-intuitive visualization and complex setup processes; which hinders its usability in clinical settings.

To address these issues, a novel image guidance system “SmartLiver” has been developed. Through incorporating augmented reality (AR) visualization, surgeons are able to visualize a 3D preoperative model of the liver overlaid on the live laparoscopic feed, thereby enabling precise navigation within a limited workspace. As a result, accurate camera calibration is vital in such systems to ensure that the 3D model is correctly aligned with the video feed. 

Current systems rely on fixed-focus stereo cameras, which maintain calibration through zoom adjustments but are costly and less widely adopted compared to mono-cameras. This highlights the need for Automatic compensation for mono-camera calibration. Unlike stereo systems, mono-cameras require frequent recalibration with zoom changes during surgery -  an impractical and disruptive solution for clinical workflows. This project seeks to automate mono-camera calibration, making AR guidance systems more accessible and effective by minimising the need for manual recalibration, thus supporting safer, more efficient laparoscopic procedures.
